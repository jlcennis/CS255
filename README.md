The client for this project was DriverPass, a fictitious company that wanted a system that let aspiring drivers to register for lesson packages and practice quizzes. I detailed functional and nonfunctional needs in this project by thoroughly addressing component functionality, as well as the system's performance and security. I could have definitely done a better job of listing the functional requirements in a less uniformed way. I incorporated the user's demands by understanding the work at hand and giving strategies to assist not only the user but also DriverPass in getting the job done effectively while safeguarding all users' personal information and creating the program to meet their needs. This is a key point to remember since users are the ones who decide whether or not a system is worth using, and if it isn't, your efforts will be in vain. With the knowledge I've gained through this project, I'm now approaching software design from the perspective of the user. This emphasizes less jargon and more simplicity, particularly in terms of user interface.
